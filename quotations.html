        <p><b><abbr title="Grand Canyon National Park"><cite>GCNP </cite></abbr> Antelope Canyon : </b>
            Visit both Lower and Upper Antelope canyons. Both are well worth your visit! You need to know that, 
            unless you are lucky, you need to book your reservations in advance. Also, Lower Antelope Canyon 
            has some steps and stairs going down into it, so if you are at all challenged you may want to stick 
            to the Upper Antelope Canyon. You also might consider a Boat Tour of Antelope Canyon. 
            Learn more about the Antelope Canyon Tours.
